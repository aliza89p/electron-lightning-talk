# [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)  
Electron is a library designed to help developers make cross-platform (Mac/Windows/Linux) desktop applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can use NPM modules, Bootstrap, Angular, Node, Gulp, etc...

- `npm install --save electron`

- It's cool because:
  - You don't have to keep a tab open in your browser to keep your application running
  - You can set up desktop notifications  
  - you can use `command + tab` to switch between windows and get to your app
